This low end 2 channel USB controller is rebranded of VDC 100M and about 10 other low end names, so check the pic and if it looks eerily similar, give it a shot.

Few physical controls, so in addition to Shifting (with the Shift key) for labelled mappings, I also incorporated sequencing, such as the Loop and Cue buttons.

Use Cue as normal, OR hold it down and use the Multi-Knob(tm pain j) which is the FX/Sampler knob. Turn it to select a Hot Cue (1-4, easily changeable, suggest you match it to Hot Cue number showing on Skin), check the Hot Cue indicators, they will clear out except for the selected Hot Cue until you release Cue, which will set or goto the Hot Cue. 0 (unseen) is the normal Cue functionality.

Loop once, set loop_in (start). Loop twice, loop_out (end) and begin looping. Use the Multi-Knob(tm) to double and halve the length. Reloop_exit, meaning jump back into and out of, the loop to your hearts content. Then Shift-Loop to clear the Loop. Sexy? Almost. Shift-Loop again (or any time Loop is clear, or unset) to throw a Beat Loop 8 bars ahead (beatlooproll_8_activate I think) and now Multi-Knob(tm) it to get your lengths with visual feedback on your Skin (aka, 1/8...32). Shift-Loop again to clear. Rinse repeat. NOW it's sexy!

The A and B buttons by shift may load the selected track, but just for now to meet the labelled usage. These will allow this limited contraption to be sexier yet. The idea is to do the labelled version, then my custom version, which will likely use my Akai MPD218 to make up for the low knobbly buttonish count of the ELMC1.

Now that's Pawn Shop Quality coding, people!
